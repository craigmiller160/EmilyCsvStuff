# CSV Stuff

Hi Emily. Here is all the CSV stuff we went over yesterday.

## Code

The code is in data.js. If you don't care about running it, you can just reference the file.

The thing to keep in mind is any variables provided by the `require()` functions at the top of the page will not be available in the browser, they are from NodeJS.

## Execution

If you want to play around with running this, do the following:

1. Install NodeJS on your computer.
2. From the Command Prompt, run `npm install` in this directory.
3. From the Command Prompt, run `npm run start` in this directory.
